# diabetes-prediction-system
Introduction:

    This README file provides instructions on how to run the code for predicting diabetes outcomes
    using machine learning. The code includes data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
    
DEPENDENCIES:

     Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
#Python (>=3.6)
#NumPy
#Pandas
#Matplotlib
#Seaborn
#Scikit-Learn

IN COLAB NOTEBOOK:

        We can read a dataset using "pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')"
IN THIS COLAB NOTEBOOK WE LOAD THE DATASET USING THE NAME "diabetes_dataset".

 ## How to Open the Colab Notebook
To open and run the Colab notebook, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Colab notebook link provided in the repository.
2. If prompted, sign in with your Google account.
3. Make a copy of the notebook: Go to "File" > "Save a copy in Drive" to create a copy in your Google Drive.
4. You can now access and edit the copied notebook in your Google Drive.

## How to Run the Colab Notebook
Once you have the Colab notebook open, follow these steps to run the code:

1. Execute each code cell sequentially by clicking the "Play" button (▶️) next to each cell.
2. The code will load the diabetes dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
3. Review the outputs, performance metrics, and visualizations in the notebook.
4.Gradient Boosting has the important part with providing best acccuracy.

## Important Notes
- This Colab notebook is provided for educational purposes and can serve as a template for similar machine learning projects.
- Ensure that you have access to the provided `diabetes.csv` dataset or replace it with your own dataset as needed.

  IN COMMAND PROMPT:
        #You can install these dependencies using 'PIP INSTALL'
        
CODE STRUCTURE
    The code is structured as follows:
diabetes.csv: The diabetes dataset in a CSV file.
diabetes_prediction.py: The Python script that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

#How to Run the Code
    Follow these steps to run the code:

        1)Ensure that you have all the dependencies installed (Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).

        2)Download the diabetes.csv file and place it in the same directory as the script diabetes_prediction.py.

        3)Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

        4)Run the Python script using the following command:
            #python diabetes_prediction.py


            The script will execute and perform the following tasks:

                1)Load the diabetes dataset.
                2)Preprocess the data, including feature selection and standardization.
                3)Train and evaluate machine learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting).
                4)Display performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report.


        #After running the script, you will see various performance metrics and visualizations in the terminal, including the accuracy of different models.
        #You can also modify the code to experiment with hyperparameter tuning or different machine learning models.

        
        IMPORTANT NOTES
       1) The code provided is for educational purposes and may require further customization for specific use cases or datasets.
        2)Ensure you have proper access to the diabetes.csv dataset or replace it with your own dataset for similar prediction tasks.
